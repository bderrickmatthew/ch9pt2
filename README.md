 My-php-framework-project

 ### Features
 - Model View Controller architecture
 - Object Oriented Programming
 - PHP 8 syntax

 ### Requirements
 - WAMP / LAMP / XAMP / WNMP / Laragon server
 - Windows 7 and above
 - PHP 8.0 and above

 ### Note:
 1. If you are using a server with apache, make sure that the .htaccess file is still in the folder, (I have provided it), and also make sure apache is configured properly to process the htaccess file, if you have still failed to configure apache, <strong><em>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO USE LARAGON SERVER</em></strong> [download it here](https://laragon.org/index.html).
 2. There is also running it straight from the command console using php command.
 3. Alternatively if you are using Visual Studio Code, press F5, after opening it as folder.
 4. The database file to be used is also provided. 
 5. In JokeWebsite.php, <strong>change</strong> the database host, user, password to match your server setup.
 6. This Project is still <strong>ONGOING</strong> and could change in the future to reflect new concepts as I continue learning.
